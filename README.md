## Decision Support System for Optimizing Healthcare Operations

This project demonstrates how healthcare data can be transformed into insights that improve patient outcomes, enhance operational efficiency, and support strategic decision-making.

Tools Used: Python · SQL · Power BI


#### Key Business Need

Healthcare organizations generate massive data, but siloed systems make it hard to use effectively. This Decision Support System (DSS) integrates patient, encounter, payer, and procedure data to give administrators a unified, actionable view of operations.

#### Data Sources

 • Patient demographics (974 records)
 • Encounters (27K+ records)
 • Payers (10 records)
 • Procedures (47K+ records)
 • Organizational details

 #### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
 
 • Operational Efficiency: Average length of stay, encounter class distribution
 • Financial Management: Payer coverage %, average cost per encounter
 • Care Quality: Readmission rate
 • Geographical Access: Patient proximity
